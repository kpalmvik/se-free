# se-free
Wraps the Domain Availability Service for Swedish .SE domains in a promised base interface available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). This makes it easy to check if a specified .SE domain is available for registration, already registered, or invalid.

The same interface may also be used to check availability of a .SE contact identifier.

## Usage

### Installation
node
```
$ npm install se-free --save
```
### Check domain availability
The isFree function returns a promise. If the backend service is responding in the expected way, the promise is fulfilled with one of the following values:
* FREE: The domain is available for registration
* OCCUPIED: The domain is already registered
* NOT_VALID: The domain does not comply with the domain naming convention and is not available for registration

If the backend for some reason does not respond in an expected way, the promise is rejected.

```javascript
const seFree = require('se-free'),
      domain = 'www.example.se';

seFree.isFree(domain)
  .then((result) => {
    if(result === 'FREE') {
      console.log('The domain "%s" is available', domain);
    } else {
      console.log('It is not possible to register the domain "%s".', domain);
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Something went wrong.');
  });
```

## Backend service
The module relies on the service provided by [free.iis.se](http://free.iis.se/).

The backend service has the following restrictions:
* A maximum of 34 requests per second and client.
* A client will be temporarily blocked after making more than 34 requests per second. The client must be idle for one second to restore access to the service.

See [Rules and description of "free"]( https://www.iis.se/english/domains/free/rules-and-description-of-free/) from [IIS](https://www.iis.se) for more details.
